## Description of website
The purpose of my portfolio website is primarily for personal branding, a platform where I am able to showcase my personal identity and skills to potential employers. It has simple functionality, where the website is only one page, where the viewer is able to switch to parts of the website via the navigation bar. It has photos, a video, plugs to social media and contact information. I used HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Flexbox and CSS Grid to create this website.
